# Cryptographic Algorithm Performance Analysis

A comprehensive benchmarking project that compares the efficiency and resource usage of four different cryptographic algorithms across various file sizes and processing loops.

## üìã Project Overview

This project systematically evaluates the performance characteristics of four widely-used cryptographic algorithms:
- **AES** (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- **Blowfish**
- **ChaCha20**
- **ECC** (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)

The analysis provides quantitative data on CPU usage, memory consumption, processing time, and encrypted file sizes to help developers and system architects make informed decisions about algorithm selection.

Each algorithm directory contains subdirectories for different file sizes, with further subdirectories for different loop counts, each containing 4 trial CSV files.

## üî¨ Experimental Design

### Test Parameters

| Parameter | Values |
|-----------|--------|
| **File Sizes** | 100KB, 500KB, 1MB, 2MB, 3MB |
| **Loop Counts** | 50, 75, 100, 125 iterations |
| **Trials** | 4 separate test runs per combination |
| **Operations** | Encryption and Decryption |

### Metrics Collected

For each test iteration, the following metrics are recorded:

| Metric | Description | Unit |
|--------|-------------|------|
| `cpu_percent` | CPU utilization during operation | Percentage (%) |
| `memory_used_mb` | Memory consumption | Megabytes (MB) |
| `process_time_sec` | Time taken for encryption/decryption | Seconds (sec) |
| `encrypted_size_bytes` | Size of encrypted output | Bytes |

## üìä Data Structure

Each CSV file contains the following columns:
- `operation`: Type of operation (encryption/decryption)
- `iteration_number`: Iteration within the loop (1-100)
- `file_size_label`: Human-readable file size description
- `cpu_percent`: CPU usage percentage
- `memory_used_mb`: Memory usage in MB
- `process_time_sec`: Processing time in seconds
- `encrypted_size_bytes`: Size of encrypted data in bytes

## üîç Analysis Methodology

The analysis notebook (`analysis.ipynb`) performs the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Recursively finds and loads all CSV files
2. **Metadata Extraction**: Parses algorithm, file size, loop count, and trial information from file paths
3. **Data Consolidation**: Combines all data into a single DataFrame
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Calculates mean, standard deviation, min, and max values
5. **Visualization**: Generates comparative charts and graphs
